# Project Overview

An NGO, Zulu Bakeries, would like to have a website to gain more customers and have sponsors to support their business. This is what the project is about: helping a non-governmental organization (NGO) by making a website to accomplish their goals, mission, and the vision they have for the company, resulting in strengthening the business. 

# Goals and objectives for the Website

This website will make the company accomplish their goals, which are to gain customers and sponsors as well as be well known around the whole province due to the NGO being discovered by a lot of online users. The website will help since a huge number of people are online and will come across this website, gaining a wider audience.

# Key features and Functinality

There will be a hyperlink that will take you directly to the webpage you have clicked. There will be a message that will display once you hover over the images of the desserts. There will be an arrow to lead the user back to their previous page. This will enhance the user experince and using simple simplicity with easy navigation.
