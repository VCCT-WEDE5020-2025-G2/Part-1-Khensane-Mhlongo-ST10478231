    <h2>Our story</h2> 

    <p>Ayanda's Grandma's bakery business started in her kitchen in her homestead in the village Umlazi.<br>
            Her delicious desserts from cakes, scones and cupcakes spread around her village.<br>
            Locals' support helped her save enough money to build a shop.<br>
            During the Covid-19 pandemic, she continued to show her gratitude by donating baked goods to the village.<br>
            This act of kindness is the reason of the slogan, "Passing Down Sweetness," which tells of the business's history from sharing her baked goods with her family and village, to passing down both her recipes and her spirit of generosity to the community.</p>
